Here are some prebuilt STATIC binaries for MIPS32 Big Endian I cross-compiled using buildroot-2020.08. Those should run on most mips32 targets without problem. They were buit on Linux Mint 19.2 x86. Just transfer them to the target machine, chmod +x and test.

For /usr/bin directory:
-nmap
-openssl
-scp
-sftp
-ssh , ssh-add, ssh-agent, ssh-copy-id, ssh-keygen, ssh-keyscan and ssh-copy-id script

For /usr/sbin directory:
-dropbear
-openvpn
-sshd
-tcpdump
